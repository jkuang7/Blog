The Behavioral Interview

Master behavioral interviews with confidence. Essential strategies and insights to excel in behavioral rounds, curated by former FAANG interviewers and hiring managers.
We've worked with a lot of candidates here at Hello Interview, and we've noticed a recurring theme: the behavioral interview is regularly overlooked.
It's easy to dismiss. You just talk about yourself, right?
Not really. Behavioral interviews carry a lot of weight in the interview process and they're shockingly easy to mess up. That said, they're also relatively easy to prepare for once you understand the fundamentals.
It shouldn't come as a surprise to you that, by default, most engineers are better technically than they are at communicating. This makes it all the more important to take behavioral interviews seriously and dedicate time to practice.
While there's a sea of resources out there for coding and system design prep, the landscape is far less clear for behavioral interviews.
In an attempt to fix this, we've created Story Builder - a free tool designed to help you craft compelling narratives for your behavioral interviews. It's our way of closing the preparation gap and giving every candidate a fair shot at showcasing their best self.
What Are Behavioral Interviews?
Behavioral interviews are designed to assess your past experiences, actions, and outcomes to predict your future performance. Different companies may call these interviews by various names – "leadership interviews," "soft skills assessments," or simply "behavioral rounds" – but they all serve the same purpose: to evaluate how well you align with the company's values and culture.
Why Are They Important?
Crudely speaking, they answer the question, "is this someone that would be a good fit for our company?"

    Cultural Fit: They assess whether you'll thrive in the company's unique environment. They help determine if you're someone others would genuinely want to work with day in and day out. Technical skills can be taught, but cultural alignment is harder to change.
    Predictive Power: Past behavior is the best predictor of future performance. Your responses give interviewers insight into how you'll handle real-world scenarios in their organization.
    Holistic Evaluation: While your resume and technical interviews showcase your skills, behavioral interviews reveal your problem-solving approach, interpersonal skills, and professional maturity.
    Career Progression: As you climb the career ladder, your ability to navigate complex interpersonal dynamics becomes increasingly important. Strong behavioral interview performance can set you apart from equally technically proficient candidates.
    Senior Interviewers: At many top tech companies, including FAANG, the most senior or experienced interviewer on the loop often conducts the behavioral interview. This underscores its importance in the hiring decision

What Are Interviewers Looking For?
Every company has a set of competencies that they use to evaluate candidates. Amazon, for instance, is well-known for using its 16 Leadership Principles to evaluate candidates at all levels. These principles, which include Customer Obsession, Ownership, and Deliver Results, serve as a framework for assessing how you have demonstrated key qualities in your past roles. Google, on the other hand, emphasizes "Googleyness," a term used to describe the set of attributes they value in their employees. This includes being comfortable with ambiguity, valuing feedback, and putting the user first. In addition to Googleyness, leadership is a key focus area for Google, even for those not applying for management roles. Meta, meanwhile, places a strong emphasis on the ability to drive impact and thrive in unstructured environments. They are interested in understanding how you have navigated challenges, collaborated with others, and achieved results in the absence of clear direction.
Despite these company-specific nuances, most FAANG and FAANG-adjacent companies share a foundational set of competencies -- even if they all call them something slightly different. As you prepare generally, especially if interviewing across multiple companies, you'll want to focus on the following:

    Conflict Resolution: How do you handle disagreements with team members or stakeholders? Interviewers want to see that you can navigate conflicts professionally and constructively.
    Perseverance: Can you push through challenges and setbacks? Demonstrate your ability to overcome obstacles and maintain focus on long-term goals.
    Adaptability: How well do you handle change? Show that you can thrive in dynamic environments and adjust your approach when necessary.
    Growth Mindset: Are you committed to continuous learning and improvement? Highlight your passion for personal and professional development.
    Leadership: Can you guide and inspire others? Even if you're not applying for a management role, showcase your ability to take initiative and positively influence your team.
    Collaboration & Communication: How effectively do you work with others and convey ideas? Emphasize your teamwork skills and your ability to communicate complex concepts clearly.

Typically, the interviewer will have the predefined competencies in front of them and will be jotting down pros and cons for each as you speak. It's in your best interest to reverse engineer what signal the interviewer is looking for and frame your narrative accordingly.
How to Deliver a Compelling Story
Your goal is to spend roughly 2-3 minutes on each story.
The most common mistake we see is candidates spending too much time on each story. They ramble on with unnecessary details, causing the interviewer to lose track of the key points. This not only makes it harder for the interviewer to evaluate your competencies, but also wastes precious interview time that could be used to share additional relevant experiences.
The key to acing your behavioral interview lies in your ability to tell compelling stories that showcase your skills and experiences within a reasonable time frame. While there are a handful of narrative frameworks, the STAR method is the most popular and effective to keep you on track and focused on the key points. Here's a breakdown:

    Situation: Describe the context or background of the event.
    Task: Explain the specific challenge or task you faced.
    Action: Describe the actions you took to address the challenge.
    Result: Explain the outcome and your role in it.

There is no need to over index on this framework, but the overarching goal is to provide the interviewer with a clear narrative that they can easily follow.
Behavioral interviews are often the most difficult to conduct as an interviewer. You're trying to listen to a story for which you have no context, while extracting meaningful signal, all the while determining what you should ask next. For the inexperienced interviewer (and there are a lot of them), this can be really challenging.
By following a framework, you're making their job easier. Helping them help you.

I tried to build a story about conflict resolution about how I handled it 10 years ago.
I escalated with the pure data and list of pros/cons for both sides, and got my way.
I antagonized other guy and learned the lesson to look for consensus which helped me avoid bigger conflicts since then.

The story builder said its a bad story because I should use an example in which I handled the conflict the correct way. I thought its a good story with drama, catharsis and the character arc.

Well I better stick to the made up story about 2 spaces vs 4 spaces indentation with the consensus to 3 spaces.

What's the difference between "Leadership" and "Collaboration & Communication" stories? I feel like my stories for both are interchangeable, which may mean I am missing something. How do I distinguish between the two?

First, often a story can and will address multiple principles. Second, the "Leadership" is trying to see if you have an strategy on how to help others grow, while "Collaboration & Communication" on how you work well with others. You are right about thinking that it's really hard for someone to be good at Leadership, without being good at "Collaboration & Communication", but the collaboration part would not be the essential for Leadership, while the communication is. An interviewer will poke on examples where there was a break in communication/disagreement when asking you a question about "Collaboration & Communication", while trying to find opportunities where you inspired, mentored, directed or commanded someone for evaluating your Leadership.

As an SWE with 6 YoE, some of frequently asked question sounds like I don't have significant stories related to that. What should I do when I'm asked those questions? Is is okay to say I don't have that kind of situation? Which way I could say in?

You probably have more stories than you might think. Start by outlining all that you've accomplished: major projects, significant milestones, initiatives, etc. Then think back about different scenarios that have happened: where were things most stressful? Did you have issues with another team member? etc.

If an interviewer asks for something that you don't have a perfect story for, talk about something nearby. "Can you tell me about a time where you led a large team to deliver?" "Let me explain a bit about this technically complex project I worked on which required coordination across the org". Be honest, but your stories don't have to fit perfectly, most of the time interviewers are used to extrapolating from something that's kind of what they asked to get the signal they need.
