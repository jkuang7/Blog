How to Prepare for Behavioral Interviews

Having helped thousands of candidates pass their FAANG interviews, we've learned exactly what works.
Most candidates approach behavioral interview preparation backwards - they start by memorizing common questions or generic frameworks. Instead, we're going to take a systematic, inside-out approach that ensures you have the pieces you need to nail your interview. Here's the process:

    Story Mining: Brainstorm your past experiences using targeted prompts to surface your best stories
    Competency Mapping: Map these experiences to key competencies that companies evaluate
    Story Crafting: Structure these experiences into compelling interview narratives using the STAR framework
    Practice and Refinement: Polish your delivery through structured practice and feedback

1. Story Mining
The goal of story mining is simple: surface your best experiences before worrying about how to tell them. Set aside 30-60 minutes and use the following prompts to brainstorm. Write down everything that comes to mind - we'll filter and refine later. Go dig up and past performance reviews, emails, and other documents that can help you remember your experiences.
Treat this like a true brainstorm: be exhaustive, even for things you don't think fit. A lot of candidates pre-judge themselves and then get stuck with an artificial limitation which keeps them from really digging into their past experiences. Just write down everything that comes to mind.
Here are some high-level prompts that can help you jog your memory.
For conflict, think about a time when...

    You disagreed with teammates or leaders
    You dealt with interpersonal challenges
    You had to navigate competing priorities
    You faced friction between teams
    You turned a difficult relationship around

For perseverance, think about a time when...

    You faced significant technical obstacles
    Things didn't go as planned
    You had to push through setbacks
    The odds seemed stacked against you
    You refused to give up despite challenges

For adaptability, recall times when...

    Everything changed unexpectedly
    You had to pivot quickly
    Plans fell through
    You worked outside your comfort zone
    You had to be flexible with your approach

To highlight growth, reflect on times when...

    You made significant mistakes
    You received tough feedback
    You took on something new
    You were initially wrong about something
    You grew significantly as an engineer

To show off collaboration, think about a time when...

    You worked across multiple teams
    You built bridges between groups
    You turned a difficult collaboration around
    You helped others succeed
    You improved how people worked together

For your results, think about a time when...

    You realized a performance improvement to some system/code
    You got kudos from your manager or peers
    You created something net-new
    You created a tool that solved a problem for you or your team
    You released something which users loved
    You spent a considerable amount of time on a project
    You coordinated with other teammates/teams/functions to deliver a project

For senior and up candidates, remember instances where you showed leadership by considering when...

    You influenced without authority
    Others followed your technical direction
    You helped grow other engineers
    You saw a need and stepped up
    You drove change across teams

For each story that comes to mind, jot down just a quick note to help you remember. We've found the following simple format to be effective:

Project/Situation: [1-2 words]
Timeline: [Month/Year]
Key Challenge: [1 sentence]
Your Role: [1 sentence]
Impact: [Numbers if possible]

So for example,

Project/Situation: Auth Service Migration
Timeline: March 2023
Key Challenge: Had to migrate 200+ services to new auth system without downtime
Your Role: Led technical design and coordinated across 5 teams
Impact: Zero downtime, reduced auth latency by 40%

As you go through this exercise, consider this set of dos and don'ts:

    Do focus on recent experiences (last 2-3 years) unless older stories are exceptionally impactful
    Do write down more than you think you'll need - aim for at least 2-3 examples per section
    Do include situations that didn't go well - learning experiences are valuable
    Do note any metrics or numbers while they're fresh in your mind
    Do not worry about storytelling yet - just capture the raw experiences
    Do not include group projects where your individual contribution isn't clear
    Do not use stories that require deep technical context to understand the impact
    Do not share experiences that are too basic for your level
    Do not include situations where you were just following orders
    Do not use stories without clear resolution or impact

At the end of this first exercise you should have a list of 10-20 raw experiences that are going to serve as the foundation for your stories moving forward. Don't worry if they feel incomplete or too much - we'll refine them in the next step when we map them to competencies.
2. Competency Mapping
Now that you have a bank of experiences, let's map them to the competencies you'll be evaluated on. Your approach here depends on your interview context:
In many cases, your recruiter will send you the list of core competencies they evaluate. Take time to review any preparation materials they provided carefully, as these competencies are exactly what your interviewer will be scoring you on during the interview.
For FAANG companies (excluding specialty roles), the set of competencies:

    Amazon: 16 Leadership Principles: Customer Obsession, Ownership, Invent and Simplify, Are Right, A Lot, Learn and Be Curious, Hire and Develop the Best, Insist on the Highest Standards, Bias for Action, Think Big, Dive Deep, Have Backbone, Deliver Results, Earn Trust, Win Together, Foster a Radical Discipline Culture, and Deliver Results
    Google: "Googleyness", Leadership, Communication, Collaboration, Product Sense
    Meta: Conflict Resolution, Driving Results, Embracing Ambiguity, Growth Mindset, and Effective Communication
    Microsoft: Adaptability, Teamwork, Customer Focus, Drive for Results, Decision-Making, Growth Mindset
    Apple: Customer Focus, Problem-Solving, Teamwork, Adaptability, Passion for Technology, Resilience, High Ethical Standards

If you aren't sure which companies you'll be interviewing at yet, or your recruiter never provided you with a set of competencies, we suggest you use this core set:

    Conflict Resolution
    Perseverance
    Adaptability
    Growth Mindset
    Collaboration & Teamwork
    Leadership (Senior+)

These competencies are largely universal enough to map well to most company-specific frameworks.
Once you have the set of competencies, you can map your experiences from the previous step to them. For each experience, determine which competency it best fits into and update your notes accordingly.

Project/Situation: Auth Service Migration
Timeline: March 2023
Key Challenge: Had to migrate 200+ services to new auth system without downtime
Your Role: Led technical design and coordinated across 5 teams
Impact: Zero downtime, reduced auth latency by 40%
Competency: Conflict Resolution

You may find that some experiences don't map to a competency, or that others map to multiple competencies.For those that don't map well to a competency, consider throwing it out, this is why we have extras! For those mapping to both, this is great, just highlight the primary vs the secondary.
3. Story Crafting
Now that you've mapped your experiences to competencies, it's time to transform them into compelling interview narratives. While we'll cover the manual process below, we highly recommend using our free Story Builder tool to streamline this step.
Story Builder guides you through crafting your stories by asking targeted questions that help surface the most interview-relevant details. It then synthesizes your responses into a polished narrative optimized for behavioral interviews. Think of it as having an experienced interviewer help you refine your stories.
Whether you use Story Builder or craft your stories manually, we recommend following the STAR framework.
The STAR Framework
Situation (20-30 seconds): Set the context briefly. Include only details relevant to understanding the challenge. Highlight scale/scope (team size, project impact, etc.).
Task (20-30 seconds): Describe the specific challenge or problem. Explain your role and responsibilities. Make clear what success looked like.
Action (60-90 seconds): Detail the specific steps you took. Focus on YOUR contributions, not the team's. Highlight key decisions and their rationale. Include how you influenced others.
Result (30 seconds): Quantify the impact where possible. Include both technical and business outcomes. Share what you learned. Keep it concise.
Story Checklists
Once you've crafted your stories, use these competency checklists to ensure they demonstrate the right signals for your level. Each competency has two parts:

    Base requirements that apply to all levels
    Additional signals expected at your specific level

Start with the "All Levels" questions for your chosen competency, then add the level-specific signals. A strong story should hit most points in both categories.

4. Practice and Refinement
I'm sure you won't be shocked to hear us say this, but practice is key. At this point, you should have some pretty good stories, but in an interview you need to also be able to deliver them with confidence in response to questions that might not be exactly what you practiced.
We strongly believe that doing a mock interview with an interviewer from your target company is by far the best way to practice. They can give you direct feedback on whether your stories hit all the right signals for their company's competencies and help you adjust accordingly. It will also test your ability to deliver under pressure and give you a strong sense of what to expect in the real interview.
Most candidates don't realize that their stories miss critical signals until they practice with someone who has actually conducted interviews at their target company.
If you can't get a mock interview, there are still several effective ways to practice. You can work with friends or colleagues who have interviewed at similar companies to get their perspective. Many people also find it helpful to record themselves telling their stories and watch it back, or practice in front of a mirror to work on their delivery. But find a way to speak out loud. Don't treat this as a silent exercise!
It's ok to have some high-level notes on stories on your desk on interview day, but avoid reading stories verbatim or referencing your notes too frequently. Interviewers get put on high-alert when candidates are coming across as over-rehearsed or scripted and typically judge more harshly. This is a conversation after all, make it feel natural.

Great content. I have some pieces of feedback.

    I feel this post should also have some section describing the various probing questions the interviewers can ask after you tell your story. It will never be that you tell your story and they will just move on to another question. There will always be probing questions.

    The story builder app needs a lot of improvement. I was hoping something magical but it just hallucinates like crazy and makes up things which is not at all present in my prompt. I just wasted 30 minutes thinking it will be good. I would advise folks to just stick with your own preparation and see if your story matches the key points mentioned in this article. Just use a timer to time your story and just talk infant of a mirror or your laptop camera to practice. That's more than enough.

Shoot, sorry to hear that. I'm going to review your stories to see where things went wrong.

We made some updates here recently to increase the amount of detail, but it looks like for stories where there was less information provided, the LLM attempts to fill in some gaps. I just made some tweaks to try to prevent this moving forward, which will go out in the next release, and we'll continue to iterate here.

Thanks for the feedback!

Excellent article - so well articulated, like all your content. Just next level work, guys. Thanks for everything you do.
A tip for anyone with extensive experience:

1 Export your 1-on-1 meeting notes or retrospective notes and upload them to Claude
2 Include the first part of this article in your prompt to help with analyzing the archived content
3 Ask Claude to generate story ideas based on what it finds in your notes

It does a surprisingly good job!

How many stories would you recommend we prepare? How much time should we allocate for each story during the interview? Should we be concerned if some stories are repeated across multiple interview rounds?

Thanks for all the tools you've been building, they are definitely making things easier for non-Leetcode Interview Prep!

Would love if you could show how the general competencies you list are mapped to Amazon leadership principles.

Edit: Even better would be if, when you select the company you're interviewing at for the Story Builder, it prompted you based on that company's principles.

Thanks again!  Really loving the System Design practice tool as well.
