Applying for senior, what do you focus in the behavioral interviews?

Feels this day like the interviews are games of the expectations. The interviewer asks a question, you need to answer it "correctly". What is the pattern here, what are the interviewers looking for?

Questions like:

    "Tell me about a project that you're most proud of",

    "Tell me about a time when you had to resolve a conflict in your team",

    "Tell me about your most challenging project",

Any hints? Feels like I can talk about most of them pretty easily, but I want to make sure I don't miss any critical thing while giving an improvised response.

Don't overthink it. Half of the test is showing that you can communicate professionally and clearly with others. If you get too preoccupied with treating every question like a puzzle with a secret "correct" answer, your responses can sound inauthentic or manipulative. When I talk to a candidate who spends the entire call trying to tell me what they think I want to hear instead of having an authentic conversation, it feels like I've learned nothing about the candidate and everything about their drive to game the system.

If you need a guide, remember the STAR mnemonic: Situation, Task, Action, Result. Speak about each of those in succession.

Using your first question as an example: If someone asks what project you're most proud of, you should quickly think about work you're proud of and then fit it into the STAR format. Talk about what you did and don't be afraid to show that you were confident in the result, even if it doesn't sound like the most impressive project. Show that you value positive results and that you're a person who likes doing well, even if the project itself isn't the most amazing thing in the world.

A candidate who is trying to game the system might hear that question and try to recall the most impressive-sounding project they've ever been a part of. They'll try to dazzle with budget sizes and user counts because they heard that numbers are good. They'll try to convince the interviewer that the project was impressive with the assumption that they will look good for having been associated with it. When the time is up, they may have even forgotten to talk about what they did for the project or why they're proud of it, other than saying that the project itself was impressive.

Be yourself. Don't treat it like a game you have to reverse engineer on the spot and then fabricate the most impressive story for the interviewers. Stick to the STAR format if you find yourself wandering.

Could not agree more. Senior+ roles require more soft skills the higher you go, people underestimate that all the time. The expectation is that you deliver, not that you personally can do everything, because they know nobody can know everything and most companies want someone who they can put anywhere and will still drive results.

When I'm interviewing for Senior+, the conversation we have is just as important as the code they write.

As a senior engineer, you should try to have as many of your examples include you doing hard engineering work but also showing how you raise the quality of people around you. Answers of the form "I had to come up with a solution for X, but it was a pretty complex problem, so I broke it in to N chunks, and I came up with an overall architecture and ownership of Chunk #1, while I had N-1 teammates who helped me with the other chunks. I did <such-and-such> to make sure everyone was aligned with the architecture throughout the project, and in a couple places had to mentor more junior engineers on what was for them stretch projects" usually play well.

    "Tell me about a time when you had to resolve a conflict in your team",

When I ask senior engineer candidates this, I want a real disagreement of consequences. Something that would impact the architecture or timeline substantially. "My teammate wanted this to be two classes, I thought it should be one" can be a useful example for a more junior engineer, but it's ultimately an easy to undo decision. For a senior engineer, it should be a decision that you had to work hard to influence, and that you can explain the steps you did in order to influence it. The more senior the person you disagreed with, the better. I'll often ask about the other person's perspective - it's important you are able to explain that, so it's not just "oh man, my coworker was dumb."

    "Tell me about your most challenging project",

For a senior engineer I work with, at some point I'm going to need to hand-off a project to another engineer, and I want someone who can figure out most reasonable-complexity problems. You might not be the one to handle all the politics (that's what managers are for 🙂 ), but you should be able to figure out most technical problems on your own. In this example, I'm looking for you to explain an example that shows you have a good set of tools for not running into roadblocks.

    I don't miss any critical thing while giving an improvised response.

The responses should be not-entirely-improvised. An interview is a conversation, the responses should be spontaneous and fit in the context of the question asked. At the same time though, when I've interviewed I had some general talking points prepared around different projects I've worked on, so that I can generally tell the story of a project and why it shows the interviewer they'll want to work with me.

I'm generally just myself though interviewers sometimes are looking for after school special stories, because I have no interest in being in an org dumb enough to believe that reality is like an after school special.

This is really only a problem for the conflict question because that one... a lot of conflicts are not suitable for conversation with people who are not there. The others you can stop way before they are a conflict, and you should. I'm not going to talk about the time the resolution of a conflict was to work with my manager and get a guy with an attitude that was dragging the team down fired, so I'm left talking about how you can get the team aligned way before conflict. Some interviewers get it, some do not.

If you want to read the official way to after school special it look up the STAR interview response and just park all your individuality and humanity at the door. I generally instead approach it like talking to a colleague and that's worked for me so far.

These questions help give a candidate a break from the technical aspects of the interview. It give breathing room to paint a narrative.

Those questions are pretty softball.

First one is to show if you have any passion.

Second one is to see if you are the type to go full on negative and bash former co-workers/employers. Heck, most of the conflict resolution is HR training stuff you can rehash -- You descalate conflict by repeating what they say, repeat, show empathy,etc...
The same tactics a salesperson de-escalate a customer in a public facing role.

Last one is a bit lame. Anything can be challenging. It is how you frame it.
I reply, "How about pushing out a product in less than a week because there was a government mandate and you had to do it without getting on the prime time news? We rose to the challenge like anyone else. Yeah, that project work in my resume." It is like asking why a Ukraninan developer went MIA in March 2024 to work on reprogramming drones. What was so challenging about that? They were busy fighting a war to drop molotov cocktails to land into tanks.

This usually diffuses the question. Of course, I tell it in a casual friendly way which is all about "resolving conflict" in an interview setting.

    "Tell me about a project that you're most proud of",

Passion. Excitement.

    "Tell me about a time when you had to resolve a conflict in your team",

Honesty.

    "Tell me about your most challenging project",

Opportunity to downgrade yourself. If you say "recursion", you're mid-level.

If you say some agile BS, you're out.

I want to see how you're able to purposefully uncover unknowns.

Wrt question 1: my follow-up question is: I get what made you proud of it and it sounds like a cool project, but what would you have done better?

A real answer here will be easily recognizable.

Also, the exact answer you give will give away at what level you operate, i.e. your real seniority.

I struggle with the "project you're most proud of". The honest answer is that I'm proud of taking a part of the product that was a raging dumpster fire, and making it adequate and fit for purpose. I feel like interviewers don't really appreciate it, though? Like "oh, you're happy being adequate? You're OK with 5 out of 10?" (Just the vibe I get, they don't literally say this). I mean, considering what a shitshow it was when I took it over, and the circumstances under which I improved it, yeah, I feel good about how far it's come. People who work in my industry have all at least heard of the product, so I'm limited in my ability to BS and insist that it is now awesome.

Is there a right way to tell a story like this? Or is it just a bad story, and I should find something else to be proud of?

As a VP Engineering I can give you a small hint here: the way you present it can mean several things. Are you going rogue and work on some crazy thing nobody needs just because you liked it? Are you arrogant and find other's stuff inadequate by default? Are you destructive and cynical and see dumpster fires everywhere? You might get put into a certain attitude stereotype that you didn't intend to.

Your example could be valuable but make a much stronger point if you were constructive and respectful, pointing out the real tangible business benefit and that it was aligned with the needs of the organization and a team effort.

This is good feedback, thanks. My perception that it was a dumpster fire is based on Net Promoter Scores. This feature used to be our #1 detractor (reason customers chose not to renew and switch to a competitor). Increasing renewal rates by making this thing suck less was a high priority for management. But I can see how, if you don’t know that, it could sound like a nerd holy war over frameworks or something.

Ok, maybe the achievement here is improving the NPS?

Honestly, this answer is way way better than what you wrote initially.

I would focus on the fact that it was the biggest detractor, which made it a company priority (I.e. you are doing things that move the needle). You then took specific steps to improve it, resulting in an increase in NPS and renewal rate.

I think this is a great story, but you have to be positive in how you say it. Start with the fact that it was the biggest detractors and talk about the valuable changes you made. Don’t say it’s mediocre, say it’s now delivering on what your company promised before and helping customers

Give me a team full of people who've been through a dumpster fire over a group of people who only know how to ride unicorns on rainbows.

One of the tricky things i that some interviewers don't like hearing people talk badly about previous companies. I've usually set up the story by saying something complementary about the team while explaining the team was missing something that I brought to the table. If you want, you can cite something like the CMMI or similar such thing to explain that it takes time to mature a software team, and that while we aren't happy being adequate, sometimes it's a win.

But I can see how, if you don’t know that, it could sound like a nerd holy war over frameworks or something.

Ok, maybe the achievement here is improving the NPS?

Honestly, this answer is way way better than what you wrote initially.

I would focus on the fact that it was the biggest detractor, which made it a company priority (I.e. you are doing things that move the needle). You then took specific steps to improve it, resulting in an increase in NPS and renewal rate.

As a VP Engineering I can give you a small hint here: the way you present it can mean several things. Are you going rogue and work on some crazy thing nobody needs just because you liked it? Are you arrogant and find other's stuff inadequate by default? Are you destructive and cynical and see dumpster fires everywhere? You might get put into a certain attitude stereotype that you didn't intend to.

Your example could be valuable but make a much stronger point if you were constructive and respectful, pointing out the real tangible business benefit and that it was aligned with the needs of the organization and a team effort.

Turn it around - if you are interviewing and someone doesn't understand why this is a better story than a project that went awesome all the way, do you want them as a coworker?

I think this is a great story, but you have to be positive in how you say it. Start with the fact that it was the biggest detractors and talk about the valuable changes you made. Don’t say it’s mediocre, say it’s now delivering on what your company promised before and helping customers

Give me a team full of people who've been through a dumpster fire over a group of people who only know how to ride unicorns on rainbows.

One of the tricky things i that some interviewers don't like hearing people talk badly about previous companies. I've usually set up the story by saying something complementary about the team while explaining the team was missing something that I brought to the table. If you want, you can cite something like the CMMI or similar such thing to explain that it takes time to mature a software team, and that while we aren't happy being adequate, sometimes it's a win.

Dumpster fires make for nice stories, it's better have folks who are through it & improved situations. They usually can identify smell from a mile away & guide teams in long run.

I struggle with the "project you're most proud of". The honest answer is that I'm proud of taking a part of the product that was a raging dumpster fire, and making it adequate and fit for purpose. I feel like interviewers don't really appreciate it, though? Like "oh, you're happy being adequate? You're OK with 5 out of 10?" (Just the vibe I get, they don't literally say this). I mean, considering what a shitshow it was when I took it over, and the circumstances under which I improved it, yeah, I feel good about how far it's come. People who work in my industry have all at least heard of the product, so I'm limited in my ability to BS and insist that it is now awesome.

Is there a right way to tell a story like this? Or is it just a bad story, and I should find something else to be proud of?

Just have a normal conversation about work stuff with your interviewer.   Be human.  Be friendly.  Be honest.   At this level, I figure you can probably do the job, I want to know if you’re a person I want to work with.

"Tell me about a time when you had to resolve a conflict in your team"

"As occasional conflict is a factor for any organization, and as I have a personal policy to never risk previous employer or coworker reputations by taking about specific incidents.

STAR - Situation, task, action, result

Don’t go too deep into the technical details. Focus on impact.

At my company these are crucial questions and also people do awful on them. They don’t have a good example, are very long winded, focus on the wrong things and skip over the good things etc etc

What kind of senior is it ? I mean, the closest I can think of is someone at 10 yoe ranging till 25 yoe. Any kind of work that we do invovles people + tech.

You should tell some stories that involves with people you've worked at or above the level you are being hired for - like an eagle view. You should also tell some stories that involved dragged out, hectic, soft skill based critical discussion over couple of months or so - at level with your parallel or lower. These should also invovle improvements or intiatives you took.

Conflict resolution has many things - you are fighting for something & point of discussion is to have a progress. You can disagree with your manager or another team's senior person or with a director or with a customer support engineer or etc. This also tells how you can gain information without offending other people (it can be for any reason), clarify what they are asking vs what they really want, long vs short term vision, mentorship vs backbone, etc.

There are many such questions & it's not easy to cover them in a single post / comment but luckily or unfortunately I had to work with loads of managers in same team + lots of ops + high impact cx work with conflicts across the board in communication + planning + ops + making feature decisions & collaboration with other team's manager + people over there + our common director + another common pm + org director + etc.

I mean it can be anything but the important thing is there is no correct answer - if you stick with something very strongly, you are bound to fail. Everything has it's tradeoffs.

Your CV should match the assignment.. other than that people usually want to see someone with halfway decent interpersonal qualities. Expect to talk about your experience a little. You're supposed to be experienced after all. Just answer the silly questions with something halfway reasonable.
