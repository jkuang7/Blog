About Chai With Jai & Princeton Idea Exchange

We help founders and legacy businesses turn big ideas into fundable proof with GTM-engineered systems—from positioning and sales motions to MVPs and dashboards. We don't chase theory; we build systems that work. Our philosophy is simple: the work has to work. We specialize in creating fundable narratives, operational excellence, and execution frameworks that convert vision into investment-ready outcomes.


Founded by Jai Bhagat, we operate at the intersection of strategy, technical execution, and go-to-market engineering—helping companies achieve product-market fit and build the operational infrastructure to scale.



Role Overview

This is not your typical Chief of Staff role. Think of it as a Jason Bourne apprenticeship in company building.


You'll start as a 3-month, part-time (~20 hrs/week) Founder's Apprentice working directly with Jai across strategy, operations, and technical execution. If you crush it, you'll transition into a full-time Technical Chief of Staff.


This is an intensive, hands-on apprenticeship designed to compress years of learning into months while shipping outcomes that unlock revenue and investment. You'll be the "get-it-done" node—equal parts systems architect, execution engine, and strategic thought partner.


This role is ideal for someone who:

    Has technical literacy but isn't precious about writing code
    Thrives in 0-to-1 environments where nothing is documented yet
    Writes first, meets second
    Ships imperfect solutions fast, then iterates
    Wants to learn company-building from the inside out



What You'll Do


Operational Systems (Writing-First)

    Implement GTD methodology across the organization; establish OKRs, company wiki, and SOPs
    Apply the principle: "When you say it twice, write it down"—document every repeatable process
    Own the tooling stack (project management, CRM, documentation) and keep it humming
    Run calendar, priorities, and information flow with ruthless clarity
    Create and maintain the company folder system and wiki (per Chapter 19 principles)

Strategic & GTM Support

    Translate vision into quarterly, measurable bets with clear OKRs
    Build crisp briefs, decision memos, and "brief → deck → decision" packets
    Conduct competitive intelligence and customer research
    Spot issues early; propose and run experiments that de-risk them
    Support the RAPID decision-making framework for complex issues
    Turn fuzzy problems into structured, written proposals with clear solutions

Technical Execution

    Ship small but high-leverage builds: automations, integrations, internal tools, dashboards
    Orchestrate vendors and contractors; keep costs low and velocity high
    Maintain the GTM engineering backbone that converts ideas to proof
    Basic scripting/data work to unblock analysis and automation
    Bridge the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders

Communication & Knowledge Management

    Draft founder communications, investor/customer updates, and decision documents
    Maintain the wiki so knowledge is easy to find and act on
    Practice Inbox Zero and teach it to others
    Facilitate writing over talking—require pre-reads before meetings
    Implement feedback loops using "Like/Wish That" framework

Business Operations

    Support fundraising materials preparation
    Assist with recruiting funnels and candidate experience
    Run special projects end-to-end
    Track company KPIs and keep them visible
    Help implement performance management systems (1-on-1s, team meetings, OKRs)



What Success Looks Like



30 Days

    GTD working for you and founder
    5+ processes documented in the wiki
    3 operational pain points identified and solutions in progress
    One quick proof asset shipped (e.g., CRM dashboard, working automation, or tracking system)

90 Days

    You're the "get-it-done" node—the person who makes things happen
    OKR tracking system live and adopted
    You own 2-3 critical workstreams end-to-end
    At least one fundable-proof artifact delivered (investor-ready deck, KPI dashboard, or MVP component)

1 Year (Chief of Staff)

    True force multiplier for the founder
    Systems you built are scaling the company
    You drive cross-functional execution
    You protect founder focus by triaging effectively
    Junior team members look to you for operational excellence




Required Qualifications


Systems Builder with Bias to Ship

    You've stood up processes, tools, or systems that others actually use
    You can point to examples of creating order from chaos
    You finish what you start


Writing-First Operator

    Briefs over meetings—you make decisions easier and faster with documents
    Strong written communication; can create clear, concise documentation
    Comfortable writing proposals even when only 10% confident in the answer


Technical Literacy

    Can wire automations and manage a modern tech stack
    Comfortable with tools like Notion, Airtable, Zapier, Google Apps Script
    Basic scripting (Python/SQL) or willingness to learn quickly
    You don't need to be an engineer, but you can talk to engineers


Extreme Ownership

    Resourceful and coachable
    Fast learner across ambiguous domains
    You figure things out or figure out who can
    Comfortable with "I don't know, but I'll find out"


Organizational Excellence

    Personally organized using GTD or similar methodology
    Nothing falls through the cracks in your world
    Experience with OKRs, KPIs, or similar goal-tracking frameworks




Preferred Qualifications


    Evidence of GTM work: positioning, sales motions, or experiments that led to fundable outcomes
    Management consulting background: You can do your own analysis on a case study that would pass a final round interview at Bain, BCG, McKinsey, or similar (but not required)
    Early-stage startup operations experience
    Executive support or Chief of Staff experience
    Experience implementing systems from books like High Output Management, Getting Things Done, or The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership
    Venture capital or fundraising experience



Working Model



    In-person strongly preferred in NYC or Princeton during apprenticeship phase (first 3 months)
    Hybrid possible after successful onboarding and trust is established
    Flexible hours around core collaboration time
    Some travel for key meetings/events
    This is a roll-up-your-sleeves, in-the-trenches role—not a remote-only position



Compensation & Growth Path


Apprenticeship Phase (3 months, ~20 hrs/week)

    Competitive hourly rate or contract arrangement (DOE)
    Milestone bonus potential based on shipped outcomes
    Direct mentorship from Jai throughout


Conversion to Full-Time Technical Chief of Staff

    Competitive compensation package
    Equity or profit-share potential based on contribution and company structure
    Path to COO/GM/VP Operations as impact scales
    Steep learning curve with real responsibility

This role offers direct exposure to company building, fundraising, product-market fit discovery, and operational excellence—condensed learning that typically takes years in traditional paths.

Our Values


Execution > Theory We're anti-guru. We build, test, and iterate. No pontificating.

Writing > Talking If it matters, write it down. Meetings are for decisions, not information transfer.

Speed to Proof Perfect is the enemy of fundable. Ship proof, then iterate.

Radical Responsibility Own outcomes. No blame, no excuses. Just solutions.

Extreme Candor Say what's true. Build trust through transparency, not politics.

We hire for talent, integrity, and cultural contribution. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds.


Evaluation is based on demonstrated ability to do the work, alignment with our operating principles, and potential for growth.


If you're the type of person who gets energized by bringing order to chaos, who writes proposals for fun, and who wants to learn company-building by doing it alongside an experienced founder—this role is for you.
